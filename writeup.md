# **Behavioral Cloning**

**Developing a Autonomous Driving Model using Behavioral Cloning

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Code Structure

#### Code Function
As outlined in the project skeleton, `model.py` uses data from the `driving_log.csv` file and `IMG/` folder to create a model `model.h5`. This model is then demoed in the **simulator's** *automatic* setting using `drive.py`.

#### Code Usage
